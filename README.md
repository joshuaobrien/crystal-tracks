# Crystal Tracks (work in progress)
Crystal Tracks is a music aggregation service. It is currently intended for my own private personal use, but I am making the code available incase others would like to use it.

There are many independent music promotion channels on YouTube that post mixes of small SoundCloud artists. The aim of Crystal Tracks is to provide a centralised playlist management service for music from these channels. This allows listeners to create their own personal mixes.

# Tech
Although still in development, it is intended for Crystal Tracks to be written using Crystal, React and Postgresql.

# FAQ
Q: Is this illegal?
A: Probably? I don't know. I am building it for my own personal use at this stage and not allowing external access. I guess it's something to look into.

Q: Can you add <feature>?
A: Maybe. Make an issue :)
